I previously played football professionally in Chile starting when I was 18. I took online courses on programming as a side hobby while playing and I quickly fell in love with it.
When my playing career was cut short prematurely, I found a silver lining in my new found passion in coding and it has given me a creative outlet to combine my love for solving problems and algorithms.
I am currently studying Computer Science at Ryerson University and I am excited to learn more about this vast field and delve deeper into topics such as Software Engineering,
Machine Learning, and Blockchain technology to name a few.
